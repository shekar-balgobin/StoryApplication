# Santander - Developer Coding Test

Using ASP.NET Core, implement a RESTful API to retrieve the details of the first n 'best stories' from the Hacker News API, where _n_ is specified by the caller to the API.

The Hacker News API is documented here: https://github.com/HackerNews/API.

The IDs for the "best stories" can be retrieved from this URI: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/beststories.json.

The details for an individual story ID can be retrieved from this URI: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/21233041.json (in this case for the story with ID 21233041).

The API should return an array of the first n 'best stories' as returned by the Hacker News API, sorted by their score in a descending order, in the form:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "A uBlock Origin update was rejected from the Chrome Web Store",
        "uri": "https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745",
        "postedBy": "ismaildonmez",
        "time": "2019-10-12T13:43:01+00:00",
        "score": 1716,
        "commentCount": 572
    },
    { ... },
...
]
```

In addition to the above, your API should be able to efficiently service large numbers of requests without risking overloading of the Hacker News API.

You should share a public repository with us, that should include a README.md file which describes how to run the application, any assumptions you have made, and any enhancements or changes you would make, given the time.
